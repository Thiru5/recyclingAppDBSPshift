Whatâ€™s unique about RecyclingExtreme is that it instructs users on how to recycle various materials and tracks what is being recycled using Google Lens. Additionally, the map functions allow users to indicate to each other where the recycling bins are. The application will  then guide users to the nearest recycling station. As this app was designed to help improve recycling with DBS reward schemes, we aim to build a community spirit in the recycling efforts as well through a group chat platform to remind and encourage each other to recycle!
